# FE-A-VOICE_EVT

Hello everyone, DeathChaos25 here!

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to document my findings for Fire Emblem: Awakening's VOICE_EVT files for each character.
They'll be neatly availble here for easy access by anyone and everyone who might find themselves needing
the numbers of this event for the creation of custom support files.

Just look for whatever character you need by referencing the event names, for example,
Cordelia is called TIAMO when calling the voice event, just go to her file, 
Both Morgans are refered to as MARC, etc, just CTRL + F and search for your character in this list 
to find out how they are refered to within the voice events.

Since GitHub numbers each line, the number of that line corresponds to the text written on it, 
meaning the number event from the line's number says the text written on it.
