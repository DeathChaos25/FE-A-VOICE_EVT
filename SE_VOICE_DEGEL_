But-
What?
No.
Huh?
Umm...
Yeah.
Yes.
*sigh*
Pathetic.
Actually...
No.
Face me!
*small tired/pained grunt*
*longer pained grunt*
Come on, then! 
Fight with me!
I'll be your shield.
Have at you!
I have this.
Thank you.
Hyaa!
Heh.
Hmph.
*pained yell*
Haaa!
We've no choice.
Don't forget me.
I'm yours.
Let's go. 
Be careful.
*pained yelp*
Why even try?
I'm with you.
Hya!
*pained grunt*
This ends here.

(The last voice clip was "this ends here" I'm actually laughing a little.)
