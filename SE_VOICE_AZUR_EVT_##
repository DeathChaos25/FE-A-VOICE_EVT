Mmm? 
*chuckle* 
Well...
Hmm...
Hey there. 
My, my. 
*distressed noises* 
C-come on!
*sigh*
Quite. 
What?
Huh?
*nervous laugh* 
*crying*
Pffa... 
*pain noise* 
All safe now. 
Heh. 
*relieved sigh* 
Not today! 
Hyya! 
Thanks. 
I have your back. 
Let's dance! 
I'm a man of passion! 
This is your last dance! 
No hard feelings? 
Nothing personal. 
Gyaahh!
Beautiful.
Steady...
You alright? 
You work fast!
*pained grunt* 
*higher pitched pained grunt* 
Let's go! 
Tsk... 
This'll be quick. 
Count me in. 
Guess I win.
