Good heavens!
Yes.
Yes?
Really?
No.
I'm a man.
Beg pardon?
Um...
*ahem*
Oh my...
*chuckle*
*sigh*
*pained gasp* 
*shorter pained gasp*
*sigh* (deeper)
In Naga's name...
May the gods bless us.
Bless you.
I'm in good hands.
Fiercely done.
God save you.
Have faith.
All will be well.
Thy will be done.
*extreme pained noise*
Away with you!
May I join you?
*Surprised yell* 
I'm here. (firm) 
We can do this. 
*pained grunt* 
Gods, forgive me!
